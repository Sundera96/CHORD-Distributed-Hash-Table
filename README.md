# Scalable Peer to Peer Look Up Service using CHORD and Java gRPC

This project implements a scalable peer-to-peer lookup service based on the CHORD protocol using Java gRPC. The CHORD protocol is a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm that enables efficient lookup of keys in a peer-to-peer network.

## Features

- **CHORD Protocol Implementation**: Utilizes the CHORD protocol for efficient key lookup in a peer-to-peer network.
- **Java gRPC**: Integrates with Java gRPC for communication between nodes in the network.
- **Asynchronous Stub**: Uses asynchronous stubs for non-blocking communication between nodes.
- **Deployable on AWS EC2**: Can be deployed on Amazon EC2 instances for real-world testing and scalability.
